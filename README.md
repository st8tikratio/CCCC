## Henceforth known as making rules for the community without broad community input and holding rewards hostage to force votes. FREEEEEDDDUMB!!!!

Also, this is implementing the same shit people bitched about during the Cardano Constitution Project from 2022. Hypocrites, so long as it improves positions, wealth, standing, progress at the expense of all others.
